# Claude Cowork — Finance Prospecting Guide

A practitioner's field guide for the **Corporate Cash Investment SVP** on using Claude Cowork, agent skills, scheduled routines, live artifacts, and GitHub integration to run a modern, AI-assisted prospecting practice.

Built on Claude Cowork GA, the February 2026 plugin expansion, and the May 2026 financial services agent launch.

## 📖 Live Guide

**[View the guide →](https://shertokj.github.io/cowork_finance_guide/)**

The guide supports two viewing modes:
- **Website mode** — full scrollable document with sticky navigation
- **Slideshow mode** — click the **Slideshow** button in the nav bar for a full-screen presentation. Arrow keys to navigate, Esc to exit. Every section, skill card, routine, and artifact becomes its own slide automatically — context slide followed by a dark terminal prompt slide.

## 🔧 Slideshow Builder Skill

This guide's slideshow mode was built and validated using the **slideshow-builder** Claude skill included in this repository.

**[Download slideshow-builder.skill →](https://github.com/shertokj/cowork_finance_guide/raw/main/skills/slideshow-builder.skill)**

### What it does

The skill enforces a strict decomposition contract: every content type maps to a fixed number of slides with defined content limits. Before any push, it spawns three archetype agents:

| Agent | Checks |
|---|---|
| **Skeptic** | Duplicate function definitions, missing edge case guards, document structure integrity |
| **Writing Style** | Em dashes in prose, emoji in callout titles, hype words, rhetorical questions, bullet lists |
| **Presenter** | Prompt word counts, rationale paragraph lengths, estimated slide overflow on 1080p |

Zero violations across all agents are required before deployment is permitted.

### Installation

1. Download `slideshow-builder.skill` from the link above or the `skills/` directory
2. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings → Customize → Skills**
3. Click **Install from file** and select the `.skill` file
4. The skill activates automatically on any slideshow-related task

### Repackaging

The full source is in `skills/slideshow-builder/SKILL.md`. To modify and repackage:
```bash
cd skills/
python3 -m scripts.package_skill slideshow-builder
```
